At Trainline we use AWS Lambda [^1] in conjunction with API Gateway
[^2] for some of our microservices. Different teams use different
languages, but in the Data Engineering team we use Clojure [^3] -
which is a JVM based functional programming language.  Here we share
some of the experiences we've had developing and deploying REST based
APIs using JVM based Lambdas.

Although we normally use Clojure, in this blog post we will present a
Java based example (for the benefit of a wider audience). However, we
expect that the same results would apply to all JVM based languages
(Clojure, Scala, Groovy, etc.)

This post is split into two parts. The first part describes our
experience building REST services with API Gateway + Lambda, while the
second part dives deeper into the usage of JVM languages for Lambda
development.

We will explore the implication of using AWS Gateway and AWS Lambda
for microservice development, and we will present our measurement
of the added latency.

In our Lambda example we go beyond the simple single-thread request
processing pattern and we leverage the full power of a naturally
multi-threaded environment such as the JVM. Although this might not
be the *standard* way to develop AWS Lambda we believe it is important
to gain a deeper understanding of JVM based Lambda implementation.

We will show with empirical evidence that the JVM is subject to a
**freeze/thaw** cycle in which all threads are temporarily frozen
while the Lambda is not processing a user request. As for the previous
part we will also explore implication of this behaviour.

The technology choice has to take into account many different factors
such as: speed of which you can deliver the solution, security,
performance, scalability, maintainability, operations, costs and the
team skill-set.  Balancing all these factors is a essential part of
modern software development. Although, there is a number of things to
keep in mind when deploying microservices with API Gateway + JVM based
Lambdas, our overall experience with these solution is very positive.


## Part 1: Microservices with API Gateway + AWS Lambda.

AWS API Gateway is a great product, which provides a good deal of
control and flexibility. For this reason we plan to use it in front of
all microservices to leverage more _serverless architecture_
[^4]. However there are a number of issues to take into account before
applying this strategy.

  * First and most importantly, API Gateway doesn't run within a
    VPC [^5], so every endpoint is exposed
    to the public Internet. There are a number of ways to secure
    endpoints, including custom authorizers and client certificates
    [^6], however it is something that needs to be kept in mind while
    designing APIs.
  * The second point to consider is **latency**. Because API Gateway
    exposes public APIs, it makes use of the AWS CDN CloudFront
    [^7]. Every request goes out through the customer's VPC Internet
    Gateway, to some CloudFront endpoint, before making its way back
    to the calling service. Since we were unable to find published
    resources which quantify these latencies, we decided to measure
    them ourselves.

In this post when talking about *latency* we are referring to the
request/response duration which includes network transfer and request
processing time, unless otherwise specified.

### The scenario.

The two questions we were keen to answer were:

  - **What is the API Gateway latency distribution?**
  - **What is the API Gateway + Lambda latency distribution?**

In other words, we wanted to understand how much latency is
added per request if we use these two technologies for our
services.

To answer the first question we created the following environment:

  * 1 x m4.xlarge EC2 instance with a load test tool.
  * 1 x m4.xlarge EC2 instance running NGINX, serving a single static JSON file.
  * Both instances were in the same region, same availability zone,
    same VPC, and same subnet.

The load test tool we used was Gatling [^8]. It is an Open Source fully
asynchronous load generator. (When measuring latencies it is very
important to use asynchronous load generators to avoid a common
latency measurement mistake known as "**Coordinated omission**" [^9]).

Gatling simulates ramping up from 1 request per second to 100 request
per second, measuring the latencies at every step. We already knew
that API Gateway scales automatically to several thousands requests
per second, so the objective of this test was not to see how far we
could push it. Instead we wanted to measure the typical latency we can
expect for the type of services we are targeting with this technology
(which are low to medium traffic microservices).

#### Measuring latency via direct connection

Firstly, we measured latencies when the load test tool directly calls
the APIs within the same VPC and AZ. This emulates the
case when two services in the same VPC and AZ communicate
directly. Here we can see the results:

  * Direct connection latencies over time (no API Gateway):

![direct-latency](/images/aws-lambda/direct-latency1.png)

  * Direct connection latencies over throughput (no API Gateway):

![direct-latency](/images/aws-lambda/direct-latency2.png)

  * Direct connection latency quantiles (no API Gateway):

![direct-summary](/images/aws-lambda/direct-summary.png)

As expected the latencies of a direct connection between two services
in the same VPC / subnet are very low, and most importantly very
stable. The median latency is sub-millisecond, with a very
stable and low 99th percentile.

#### Measuring latency via API Gateway connection

The second measurement we performed is when the load test tool accesses the
service via API Gateway. This reveals how much
latency overhead is added by using API Gateway.

  * Proxied connection latencies over time (via API Gateway):

![api-gateway-latency](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-latency1.png)

  * Proxied connection latencies over throughput (via API Gateway):

![api-gateway-latency](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-latency2.png)

  * Proxied connection latency quantiles (via API Gateway):

![api-gateway-summary](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-summary.png)

Here we can clearly see that the latency is more unstable. The added
latency for every request is between 12ms and 42ms, the jitter is the
in order of 10ms, and the maximum time for a single request was
1516ms. This worst case of 1.5s added on top of
the typical response time is high, but luckily it doesn't happen very
often.

#### Measuring latency via API Gateway + Lambda

Finally we wanted to see how much latency is added when implementing
microservices as AWS Lambda functions with API Gateway on top. The
test Lambda itself is trivial - it just doubles a number (code shown
later). The typical execution time of the doubling code (including the
request and response marshalling) is trivial; in the order of
150-200μs.  Therefore all the latency reported in the following charts
may be fairly attributed to the API Gateway and Lambda machinery.

  * API Gateway + Lambda latency over time:

![api-gateway-lambda-latency](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-lambda-latency1.png)

  * API Gateway + Lambda latency over throughput:

![api-gateway-lambda-latency](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-lambda-latency2.png)

  * API Gateway + Lambda latency quantiles:

![api-gateway-lambda-summary](/images/aws-lambda/api-gateway-lambda-summary.png)

As shown here, the latencies are much higher when API Gateway and
Lambda are used. Microservices implemented using API Gateway + Lambda
incur a latency 'tax' of **37-109ms per request**. The wide range of
latency and the high spikes are probably attributable to Lambda
container creation. An interesting observation is that the latencies
seems to be more jittery at lower throughput levels (15-35 requests
per second).  On its own, 37-109ms per request is not too
bad. However, if you consider a typical microservice architecture
where one frontline service makes a number of requests to other
services before returning the final response, you can see how these
latencies would become the dominant part of a user request, and
(probably) an unacceptable overhead.

## Part 2: AWS Lambdas, Java threads and the JVM freeze/thaw.

So far we have seen some of the things to keep in mind when
considering the use of API Gateway and Lambda for microservices. Now
we will explore in more detail our findings around using AWS Lambda
with JVM based languages.  While developing a Lambda service we
stumbled upon an issue which lead us to gain a deeper understanding of
AWS Lambda itself.

### The scenario.

Monitoring production APIs is a standard requirement these days. AWS
Lambda has a few metrics available by default in CloudWatch
[^10]. However, if you require more detailed metrics you have to fall
back on more traditional approaches and tools. At Trainline we use New
Relic for most of our production monitoring, and therefore we opted to
use it for monitoring Lambdas. Amongst other things, this gives us a
single place to see most of our service metrics. One thing to keep in
mind is that the behaviour described in this article is _NOT_ peculiar
to New Relic itself, and it will be common to any tool where metrics
are published asynchronously. _In fact, is not even specific to
monitoring tools at all, it is just how we came about to find this
specific Lambda's behaviour. Any background operation or communication
to a database or external service would suffer for the same issues we
are describing in this post_.

We make use of the New Relic Insights API [^11], which
boils down to a HTTP POST with a JSON payload containing the events
and facets we wish to track.

A common approach for event based monitoring like this is to buffer a
number of events in memory and then use a background thread to publish
the data to the tool (in our case New Relic). (In this discussion we
will refer to a _"background thread"_ as a thread which is not
processing client requests). The approach has several advantages:

  * **it doesn't impact the request thread**. Events are passed to a
    dedicated thread so that the main request thread is not impacted.
  * **buffering**. It buffers a configurable number of events in
    memory before making the "expensive" (100ms-120ms) request to the
    API.
  * **decoupling**. The processing of the Lambda requests and the
    metrics collection concerns are well separated, and they have well
    defined failure handling modes. For example if the POST to
    New Relic API fails for any reason it won't impact the request
    thread, and handling it could be as easy as retrying the
    request some time later.


The following image depict the scenario where the `λ-thread` and the
`BufferingAgent` belong to the same JVM process which is running the
AWS Lambda. The `BufferingAgent` runs in a _background thread_.

![background-thread](/images/aws-lambda/background-thread.png)

## The problem.

**We found that the approach described above doesn't work on AWS
Lambda.** The following section details our findings and explains why
it doesn't work.

In the main AWS documentation [^12] there isn't much detail about the Lambda
lifecycle. Another blog post [^13] tries to explain how containers are
allocated and reused. However none of the resources we've found
detail exactly what happens to the container / JVM once the execution of the
request terminates.

What we expected is that background threads would keep working - as in a
standalone JVM - and therefore we could push the metrics to New Relic.
What really happens is that we can't get any data into New Relic and
from time-to-time we get a `SocketException` with a
`OperationNotPermittedException`.

Once we ruled out any programming error in our code, we noticed that
the same code was working correctly when the HTTP POST to New Relic was
done in the Lambda request thread (synchronously), rather than in the
background thread. So we started investigating how threads get
scheduled in an AWS Lambda. The question we tried to answer was: _"What
happens to the JVM when the a Lambda request completes?"_

### What happens to the JVM when the a lambda request completes?

In some of the AWS documentation and blog posts [^13] we found reference to a
_container freeze/thaw_ process, but there was not enough detail to understand
what is actually happening.

In order to find out how threads are scheduled in Lambda based JVMs we
did the following experiment. We wrote a simple AWS Lambda function
which, the first time it gets initialised, starts a background thread
which logs a message. It then goes to sleep for `1 second`, and then
loops. The Lambda itself expects a value, and it returns the value
doubled.

Here is the sample code for the `handleRequest` for our `FreezeThawLambda` class:

``` java
    public Value handleRequest(Value request, Context context){
        log.info("request value:" + request.getValue());
        return new Value( request.getValue() * 2);
    }
```

And this is what the request/response POJO looks like:

``` java
public class Value {

    long value = 0L;

    public void setValue( long aValue ){
        value = aValue;
    }

    public long getValue(){
        return value;
    }

    public Value(){
    }

    public Value( long aValue ){
        value = aValue;
    }
}
```

When the AWS Lambda machinery instantiates our Lambda we start a
background thread with this code.

``` java
    public FreezeThawLambda(){
        log.info("FreezeThawLambda created.");
        startBackgroundThread();
    }

    private void startBackgroundThread(){
        log.info("Starting background thread.");
        new Thread(){
            public void run(){
                int i = 0;
                while( true ){
                    long start = System.nanoTime();
                    FreezeThawLambda.sleep(1000);
                    long stop = System.nanoTime();
                    log.info( "background thread alive, iteration: " + ++i + " slept for: " + duration(start, stop));
                }
            }
        }.start();
    }
```

The full code used for this test can be found on our Github repository [^14].

If this code was running on a _"normal"_ JVM the output would look
like the following:

``` text
2016-09-06 12:04:32 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:12 - FreezeThawLambda created.
2016-09-06 12:04:32 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:26 - Starting background thread.
2016-09-06 12:04:33 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 1 slept for: 1002
2016-09-06 12:04:34 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 2 slept for: 1004
2016-09-06 12:04:35 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 3 slept for: 1000
2016-09-06 12:04:36 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 4 slept for: 1003
2016-09-06 12:04:37 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 5 slept for: 1001
2016-09-06 12:04:38 <> INFO  FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 6 slept for: 1003
```

As you can see, the background thread gets scheduled pretty
regularly at `1 second` intervals.

Once deployed to AWS lambda and run for a few test requests, the output
found in CloudWatch looks like the following:

``` text
2016-09-06 11:09:45 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:12 - FreezeThawLambda created.
2016-09-06 11:09:45 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:26 - Starting background thread.

2016-09-06 11:10:01 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 3 slept for: 12166
2016-09-06 11:10:01 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:19 - request value:20
2016-09-06 11:10:06 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 4 slept for: 5951
2016-09-06 11:10:06 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:19 - request value:20
2016-09-06 11:10:25 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 5 slept for: 18364
2016-09-06 11:10:25 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:19 - request value:20
2016-09-06 11:10:26 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:34 - background thread alive, iteration: 6 slept for: 1552
2016-09-06 11:10:26 <> INFO FreezeThawLambda:19 - request value:20
```

The first thing to notice is that no output was sent to CloudWatch
_unless a request was in-flight_. The first request would have
instantiate the container, and after that the background thread should
have been running and producing one log entry every second. However,
as you can see from the logs above, the background log lines are _not_
being emitted once per second. Instead they appear at variable intervals with
irregular sleep times. The second thing to notice is that the
background log lines are interleaved with the acutal request log
lines. What we found is that the background thread is only emitting
lines _while a request is being processed_.

What we think is happening - and what our experimental evidence
seems to suggest - is that after the Lambda request thread completes the
AWS Lambda machinery it `freezes` the JVM, and later `thaws` it when a new
request is incoming.

If we had to speculate about how this is happening, we would imagine
that the AWS Lambda scheduler uses **Linux cgroups** [^15] and **Linux
Kernel namespaces** [^16] to isolate lambda executions.  Once the
processing of a Lambda request is completed the **CPU shares** for the
given container get set to zero. **CPU shares** define the amount of
CPU each container is allocated to use. They are denominated as 1024
shares for each CPU core.  So for example 512 CPU shares equates to
half of one CPU core, while 1024 is a full CPU core, etc. We would
imagine that setting it to zero would tell the scheduler to never
allocate time to a given process, effectively causing the JVM to
**freeze**. Upon a new Lambda request, the CPU shares are restored to
their original value, causing the JVM process to **thaw** to a normal
running state. Of course, this is just speculation - as AWS don't make
the Lambda internals public domain.

Although it isn't relevant how AWS implemented their Lambda
infrastructure, we think it is important to have a deeper understanding
of the Lambda lifecycle so that JVM developers who want to use
this service know what behaviour they can expect.

We can easily understand the commercial reasons behind the freeze/thaw
process, so that AWS Lambda users are billed for the _"effective"_
time they use CPU resources, but as JVM developers we need to consider
some of the consequences:

  - _No progress can be made outside the request timespan by any
    thread._ Therefore, forget about asynchronously pushing metrics to
    monitoring systems, and pre-fetching or refreshing internal
    caches.
  - The JVM Garbage Collector won't be able run minor collection in
    background - unless there is a running request. Similarly, the JVM Young
    Generation GC which is known to **stop-the-world** [^17] will only happen
    when a request is being processed. In turn, it will add more
    latency to the request processing.
